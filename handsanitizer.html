        <p>Hand Sanitizers help prevent Coronavirus (COVID-19) from affecting you and your family. Perhaps the most important thing to know is that medical experts agree on this: One of the best ways to stay healthy is to wash your hands with soap and water. But if those are not available, hand sanitizer may help rid your hands of unwanted germs.when you use hand sanitizer, make sure you do so the right way. Find the directions on the back of the bottle and follow the proper technique. Generally, apply the liquid to the palm of one hand. Then rub it all over both hands until the sanitizer dries. This takes about 20 seconds. Be careful not to wipe the sanitizer off before it is dry. Doing that can make it not as effective in killing germs.</p>
