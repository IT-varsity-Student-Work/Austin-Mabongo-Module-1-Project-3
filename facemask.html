        <p> wear a cloth face mask in places where it can be hard to stay 6 feet away from others, like grocery stores. That is because studies show that people can spread coronavirus even if they do not have symptoms (called asymptomatic) or before they have symptoms (called presymptomatic). In fact, you might be the most contagious just before symptoms begin.</p>
