        <p>For many of us it is now standard to don a face mask to go to the grocery store, the pharmacy, or on public transportation. But some people are wearing another type of face covering ,a clear plastic shield that covers their entire face known as a face shield.Face shields do twice the job the face mask does.It covers the entire face making it hard to contract the virus.</p>

        <p>Shields have a number of advantages over masks, they added. First of all, they are endlessly reusable, simply requiring cleaning with soap and water or common disinfectants. Shields are usually more comfortable to wear than masks, and they form a barrier that keeps people from easily touching their own faces.When speaking, people sometimes pull down a mask to make things easier -- but that isn't necessary with a face shield. And "the use of a face shield is also a reminder to maintain social distancing, but allows visibility of facial expressions and lip movements for speech perception."</p>
