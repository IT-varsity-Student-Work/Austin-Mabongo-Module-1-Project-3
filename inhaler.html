        <p>Talk with your healthcare provider, nurse, or pharmacist about how to use the inhaler prescribed for you. Also make sure you read and follow the instructions that come with the device. And, make sure you know how to keep your inhaler or nebulizer clean.Inhalers are designed to deliver medication directly to the lungs through a person's own breathing. This may benefit a patient by providing medicines directly to areas of disease, allowing medication to take a greater effect on its intended target, and limit side effects of medications due to localized treatment.[1] Inhalers are used in a variety of different medical conditions with diseases of the lungs and respiratory system being among the most common. These conditions utilize medications designed to decrease airway inflammation and obstruction to allow for easier and less strained breathing.</p>
